## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a first year student at Cornell interested in robotics and mechatronics, especially in robot-human collaboration to increase efficiency and create safer environments. I was on an FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team for all four years of high school on mechanical/machining teams and I interned at Analog Devices, inc. where I worked on tool-tending robotic systems in the semiconductor manufactoring processes. 

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/_layouts/project.html/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
