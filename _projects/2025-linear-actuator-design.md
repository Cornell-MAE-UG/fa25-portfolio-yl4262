## Purpose: 
Statics and Mechanics of Materials Project
Problem: 
Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length, 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator. We were challenged to find the configuration to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height.
